# Plants in Time and Space

Planting a  garden is very much imagining something that's not there...You're putting something in the ground that is borth entirely different from the thing which will arive and entirely the same. It's preciesely two things or more at once. It's like time travel too. Which is what metaphor is. It's saying that these two things are true, simultaneously" ("Wild Love")

## Human vs Plant Time

"To human observers, plants’ temporalities appear out of sync, simultaneously fresh and primordial..plants live, move, 
and strive in time frames that often evade humans" (Forbes 49).
