# Gardens Are Magic
"For me, the magic would always begin in the garden" (Depestre 196).

# Plants are the Future
Planting a  garden is very much imagining something that's not there...You're putting something in the ground that is both entirely different from the thing which will arrive and entirely the same. It's preciesely two things or more at once. It's like time travel too. Which is what metaphor is. It's saying that these two things are true, simultaneously" ("Wild Love")

## Plant Time is not Human Time

"To human observers, plants’ temporalities appear out of sync, simultaneously fresh and primordial..plants live, move, 
and strive in time frames that often evade humans" (Forbes 49).

# Treatment of Plants is inseparable from treatment of humans
Carl Linnaeus "not only categorized plants but also animals and within the general category of animal, 'homo sapiens'…not merely of 'type' but also of value, breaking down the unit 'homo' into not just Homo Sapins and Homo monstrous but six varieties: wild man, American, European, Asiatic, African, and monsters including 'man-made ones'"(Casid 3).

# Appropriation of Plant Knowledge--Ferns of the Imagination
 "In fact in collecting plants, Sloane and other European collectors depended on the local knowledge of both aboriginal peoples and African slaves who passed on information on the speciﬁc medical uses of exotic plants unknown to Europeans" (Mimi Sheller 17)

"My father, an amateur botanist, had wanted to please us by cultivating not only the plant life particular to Haiti and the Dominican Republic, but flora from all over the Caribbean, from Cuba to Trinidad, passing by Jamaica, Martinique, Guadeloupe, and the entirety of the French Antilles" (Depestre 196)

"Thus there was a sample of each and every species of flowering plant blossoming outside our house, from the most humble to the most spectacular" (Depestre 196)

# Removal from Natural Environment
It is thus to the interest and benefit of colonial botanical projects of domination to purposefully remove plants from their natural environment. In other words, colonial imagery is an intentional project of time and space in which the illusion is that these plants exist outside time and space, when, in reality, they are inextricably rooted in colonial forms of domination.

# Connections to Antebellum South
"the colonization of the Americas initiated a global movement of plants as well as of peoples and diseases. Early European colonists set out to document and collect new plant species from the Americas, hoping to find new commodities and make their American colonies less dependent on European medicines" (Fett 62-63)

# Enlightenment Taxonomies
"The Enlightenment project of European botanical classification emerged in part from the collection of exotic plants that accompanied colonization of Native American lands and the forced transportation of Africans to plantation labor" (Fett 63).

# Flora of the Caribbean
"All the flora of the Caribbean imaginary was in my sight and within my reach, leaving me susceptible to their intoxicating fragrances from morning till night. With its hundreds of species, our garden was a sort of botanical feast--as representative of the coast of the mountains, the wildest forest as of the tamest, most well-manicured garden" (Depestre 197).

# Garden as Ornamental Spectacle
In the French, however, it says instead of "most well-manicured garden" "de la forêt des plantes ornementales" (Depestre 176--FR)
This is a completely different implication, because ornamental plants purely for the point of spectacle were key features of colonial botany

# Garden as Creole Space
Hadriana subverts the colonial origin and legacy of this garden by pinpointing it as a source of her rebellion, imagination, and passion.  "If there was anything strange about the young girl, about her wandering and vagabond nature, it easily could have been summed up in the two syllables of the word *garden*" (Depestre 197)

# Plants as Liberatory
"Everything in me--the spirit of childhood, a voracious sensuality, the Haitian gift for wonderment, the impulsive humour of the French, all my joy at being in the world…there before the trees and the sun-drenched hedges of our garden" (Depestre 197).

# Garden Collapses Time and Space
"Just as others might head aimlessly down any number of roads, testing their vagabond love of life by visiting diverse climates, all I needed to do sample all of life's finest and most joyful passions was head down to our garden!" (Depestre 197-198).

This work, *Hadriana in All My Dreams*, is by René Depestre, and Hadriana is transformed into a zombie by lemons--a plant found in her father's botanical garden.
"Truth be told, my false death had begun half an hour before I cried out in the church" (Depestre 165).
"A pitcher of lemonade awaited me on the oak dresser, plain as day. I poured myself a tumbler-full, then a second, then a third, drinking each glass to the very last drop until my thirst was entirely quenched. In the heat of that nuptial oven, the cool lemonade was intoxicating" (Depestre 165-166)!

# Caribbean as Eden Trope
In Jacmel Balthazar "let her see in a dream the space between purgatory and Eden, a bay whose beauty resembled the area carved out by the Caribbean Sea in the Jacmelian coastline" (Depestre 41).
Playing on the trope of Caribbean as Eden
Mimi Sheller explains how the Caribbean "is represented as a perpetual Garden of Eden in which visitors can indulge all their desires and ﬁnd a haven for relaxation, rejuvenation, and sensuous abandon (13).
