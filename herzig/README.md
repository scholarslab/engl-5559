In this visual essay, I will (un)catalog Hadriana's father's garden by visualizing each of the plants listed firstly with a colonial print, which indicates the imperialist imagination of plants as separate from their natural environment, thus rationalizing their extraction and appropriation. I will subsequently provide a twenty-first century photograph that will contrast how the plants look in real life (this can be accessed by clicking on the secondary image for each slide). I will begin by providing background into how botanical science is historically rooted in racial hierarchies of colonialism, transitioning to the plants themselves, and culminating by considering Hadriana's reimagination of her father's garden as a creole space.

# Appropriation and Categorization of Plant Knowledge: Plant problems are human problems
Carl Linnaeus, the founder of European botanical taxonomies, "not only categorized plants but also animals and within the general category of animal, 'homo sapiens'…not merely of 'type' but also of value, breaking down the unit 'homo' into not just Homo Sapins and Homo monstrous but six varieties: wild man, American, European, Asiatic, African, and monsters including 'man-made ones'"(Jill Casid 3).

Playing on the colonialist trope of Caribbean as Eden, Mimi Sheller explains how the Caribbean "is represented as a perpetual Garden of Eden in which visitors can indulge all their desires and ﬁnd a haven for relaxation, rejuvenation, and sensuous abandon (13). Depestre acknowledges this Edenic setting, when the character Balthazar projects "in a dream the space between purgatory and Eden, a bay whose beauty resembled the area carved out by the Caribbean Sea in the Jacmelian coastline" (Depestre 41).

 # Removal from Natural Environment, the beginning an artificial Garden of Delight
It is thus to the interest and benefit of colonial botanical projects of domination to purposefully remove plants from their natural environment. In other words, colonial imagery is an intentional project of time and space in which the illusion is that these plants exist outside time and space, when, in reality, they are inextricably rooted in colonial forms of domination. The beginning of the un/de/recataloguing begins with this image.

Going so far as to remove the stems, tree, and any other indicators of an environmental context to solely acknowledge the literal fruits of the labor that benefit humans, this print descends from this legacy of colonial removal. The description refers to this scarlet plum as a specimin, furthering the purposeful dehumanization.

S.M. Fett explains that "the colonization of the Americas initiated a global movement of plants as well as of peoples and diseases. Early European colonists set out to document and collect new plant species from the Americas, hoping to find new commodities and make their American colonies less dependent on European medicines" (62-63)

"Truth be told, my false death had begun half an hour before I cried out in the church" (Depestre 165).
"A pitcher of lemonade awaited me on the oak dresser, plain as day. I poured myself a tumbler-full, then a second, then a third, drinking each glass to the very last drop until my thirst was entirely quenched. In the heat of that nuptial oven, the cool lemonade was intoxicating" (Depestre 165-166).

This purloining of plants reflects typical colonial attitudes of taking plants from colonized spaces for one's own garden, as Hadriana rationalizes, "My father, an amateur botanist, had wanted to please us by cultivating not only the plant life particular to Haiti and the Dominican Republic, but flora from all over the Caribbean, from Cuba to Trinidad, passing by Jamaica, Martinique, Guadeloupe, and the entirety of the French Antilles" (Depestre 196).

# Amazing Glitches in the Garden
## Breaknail
This plant is listed, but I cannot find any record of it existing as a real plant.

## Mountain Blueberry
This naming is inherently a creolization, since there is no mountain blueberry, but a mountain laurel from the blueberry family.

# Garden Collapses Time and Space
"Just as others might head aimlessly down any number of roads, testing their vagabond love of life by visiting diverse climates, all I needed to do sample all of life's finest and most joyful passions was head down to our garden!" (Depestre 197-198).

# In Conclusion: What are the Provocations that Plants Propose?
Planting a  garden is very much imagining something that's not there...You're putting something in the ground that is both entirely different from the thing which will arrive and entirely the same. It's preciesely two things or more at once. It's like time travel too. Which is what metaphor is. It's saying that these two things are true, simultaneously" ("Wild Love")

"To human observers, plants’ temporalities appear out of sync, simultaneously fresh and primordial..plants live, move, 
and strive in time frames that often evade humans" (Forbes 49).
