# Plants in Time and Space

Planting a  garden is very much imagining something that's not there...You're putting something in the ground that is borth entirely different from the thing which will arive and entirely the same. It's preciesely two things or more at once. It's like time travel too. Which is what metaphor is. It's saying that these two things are true, simultaneously" ("Wild Love")

## Human vs Plant Time

"To human observers, plants’ temporalities appear out of sync, simultaneously fresh and primordial..plants live, move, 
and strive in time frames that often evade humans" (Forbes 49).

# Hadriana's Garden--Sea Grapes
"For me, the magic would always begin in the  garden. My father, an amateur botanist, had wanted to please us by cultivating not only the plant life particular to Haiti and the Dominican Republic, but flora from all over the Caribbean, from Cuba to Trinidad, passing by Jamaica, Martinique, Guadeloupe, and the entirety of the French Antilles" (Depestre 196)

# Sample of Every Species

"Thus there was a sample of each and every species of flowering plant blossoming outside our house, from the most humble to the most spectacular: from sea grape to leatherwood; from morning glories to cabbage palmettos; from cinnamon bark, with its smell of cassis" (Depestre 196).

# Breadfruit

Breadfruit is a plant specifically tied to the slave trade that is in Hadriana's father's garden

# Flora of the Caribbean
"All the flora of the Caribbean imaginary was in my sight and within my reach, leaving me susceptible to their intoxicating fragrances from morning till night. With its hundreds of species, our garden was a sort of botanical feast--as representative of the coast of the mountains, the wildest forest as of the tamest, most well-manicured garden" (Depestre 197).

# Garden as Ornamental Spectacle
In the French, however, it says instead of "most well-manicured garden" "de la forêt des plantes ornementales" (Depestre 176--FR)
This is a completely different implication, because ornamental plants purely for the point of spectacle were key features of colonial botany

# Garden as Creole Space
Hadriana subverts the colonial origin and legacy of this garden by pinpointing it as a source of her rebellion, imagination, and passion. "If there was anything strange about the young girl, about her wandering and vagabond nature, it easily could have been summed up in the two syllables of the word garden" (Depestre 197)

# Plants as Liberatory
"Everything in me--the spirit of childhood, a voracious sensuality, the Haitian gift for wonderment, the impulsive humour of the French, all my joy at being in the world…there before the trees and the sun-drenched hedges of our garden" (Depestre 197).

# Garden and the Imagination
 The garden becomes a liberating space of creolization and "adolescent dreams" (Depestre 197). Garden as a way of collapsing time and space, because "Just as others might head aimlessly down any number of roads, testing their vagabond love of life by visiting diverse climates, all I needed to do sample all of life's finest and most joyful passions was head down to our garden!" (Depestre 197-198).

 ## Lemons in Hadriana
This work, *Hadriana in All My Dreams*, is by René Depestre, and Hadriana is transformed into a zombie by lemons--a plant found in her father's botanical garden.
"Truth be told, my false death had begun half an hour before I cried out in the church" (Depestre 165).
"A pitcher of lemonade awaited me on the oak dresser, plain as day. I poured myself a tumbler-full, then a second, then a third, drinking each glass to the very last drop until my thirst was entirely quenched. In the heat of that nuptial oven, the cool lemonade was intoxicating" (Depestre 165-166)!

# Caribbean as Eden Trope
In Jacmel Balthazar "let her see in a dream the space between purgatory and Eden, a bay whose beauty resembled the area carved out by the Caribbean Sea in the Jacmelian coastline" (Depestre 41).
Playing on the trope of Caribbean as Eden
Mimi Sheller explains how the Caribbean "is represented as a perpetual Garden of Eden in which visitors can indulge all their desires and ﬁnd a haven for relaxation, rejuvenation, and sensuous abandon (13).
