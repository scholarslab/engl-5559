France occupies the first section in the world Atlas of Wine; the section begins: “Despite the best efforts of the country’s temperance lobby, it would be impossible to think about France without wine as it is to think of wine without France” (Johnson & Robinson 52). In one sentence, the epistemology of an empire is inextricable from viticulture, while the moral standing of the country against wine is also reified; there is a strong implied contrast of superiority to countries without the refinement of “temperance lobbies.” The passage continues: “The map shows France’s administrative departments and, arguable more important to national pride and pleasure, her many varied wine regions” (Johnson & Robinson 52). European cartographies and geographies display an administrative and agricultural state on the map, overlayed and interlaced. “National pride” is not only tied to “administrative departments” and wine regions but also to “international pleasure”—the successful export of France’s agricultural products in a globalized world. Continuing in the same passage: “Names such as burgundy and champagne have long been so redolent of greatness in wine that, much to the disgust of the French, they have in their time been liberally borrowed without apology” (Johnson & Robinson 52). And here is the spread of imperial influence, the desire for other nation-states to establish themselves as “cultivated,” in all its senses, by copying the established standard-bearer of the most culturally important European agricultural crop. A few paragraphs later: “France still supplies more great wine, and in greater variety, than any other country. Geography is key. France, washed by the Atlantic and lapped by the Mediterranean, is uniquely well situated with the influence of the continent to the east, and a rich variety of soils, including more of the precious calcaire (limestone) so propitious to wine quality, than any other country” (Johnson & Robinson 52). The “still” in this passage is interesting—what it suggests, and what will go on to be a topic of this paper, is the rise of wine elsewhere, especially in the United States. And finally, from this section: “But Frances not only has good vineyards; she defines, classifies, and controls them in more detail and has a longer history of this, and producing fine wine, than any other country…” (Johnson & Robinson 52). The imperial administrative state and the agricultural state are one and the same, both reliant on each other—definition, classification, and control, tools of the empire, are what make for good wine.

## Section 2
       
Wine has been tied up with the cultural imaginary of empire in the west for millennia; a book about wine in America attributed the quote “Nothing more excellent or valuable than wine was ever granted by the god to man” to Plato. Whether or not he said that (it seems unlikely ), the implication is of America carrying on some classical practice or thought, placing wine as a through line connecting a series of empires. Not only this there a romantic notion of wine and its place in the west, but the qualities of what makes a great wine, decided upon by this empire, are, in fact, an expression of imperial power—classification, large amounts of land over various climates, regulation, worldwide trade, and bureaucracy. Pictured are two wines from “We the People” winery, a politically conservative producer that donates part of its profits to causes that “reflect our values.” How did wine get enmeshed with American supremacy and empire such that this group selling abhorrent values would use wine as its vehicle?

 ## Section 2
 It is no surprise, considering the implications and entanglements of viticulture with empire, that producing grapes has been an American obsession since colonists arrived and grew with the imperial aspirations of the country. While early colonists found many wild grapevines, “European vinifera vines…withered up and died” (Johnson & Robinson 289). But colonists continued to try. Two of the most notable attempts came in the period came from two of America’s founding statemen, George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. In 1760, Washington tried planting Madeira grapes at Mount Vernon. (Citation) This experiment evidently failed, as eight years later, he wrote to a trading company in Madeira for more vine clippings. (Citation) These failed as well, and Washington turned to try to cultivate wild American grapes for his purposes. However, even as late as 1779, Washington had not given up hope, writing to Phillip Mazzei, an Italian living in Albemarle County on land given to him by Thomas Jefferson, about his attempts to grow Old-World grapes in America:

I thank you for your obliging acct of the culture of the Vine, and am happy to hear that your plantation of them is in so prosperous a way. I have long been of opinion from the spontaneous growth of the vine, that the climate and soil in many parts of Virginia were well fitted for Vineyards & that Wine, sooner or later would become a valuable article of produce—The relation of your experiments convince me I was right. (From George Washington to Phillip Mazzei, 1 July 1779)

Not only was the cultivation of grapes of significant interest to George Washington, but Thomas Jefferson made an explicitly imperial project of it, writing about and attempting to do so to refute a charge of American degeneracy made by prominent European writers like the Abbe de Pauw, the Count de Buffon, and the Abbe Raynal (citation). This theory, which posited that the American climate contributed to degeneracy in Europeans who moved there and the flora and fauna of the continent, was a direct point of contention in Jefferson’s Notes of the State of Virginia, in which he cataloged and mapped the state. This work is at once an attempt to show that physically the new world was not degenerate—smaller, less populated, or less moral—as well as an explicit act of the kind of definition, classification, and control over the natural world associated with good wine-making. For Jefferson, the cultivation of fruit, in general, was evidence to resist this charge of degeneracy: “Vision of cosmopolitanism, rural happiness, and profitable transatlantic trade were intertwined with grape vines, olives, and oranges being planted at Monticello…”(Pauly 10). Of these, grapes were the most important example; he imported Phillip Mazzei and gave him land near his own, hoping to recreate Piedmont in central Virginia. For two years in a row, they attempted plantings at their estates, and in both years, frost killed the entire crop—Washington must have heard something else (Pauly 26). These early attempts failed, but Americans did not give up attempting to cultivate grapes. The plant, and its cultivation, were and are too wrapped up in imperial power and desires; as Pauly puts it, “Vinifera was the indicated species of culture, a climate that fostered fine grapes was a prima facie good one” (Pauly 29).

## Section 3
One of the heights of this obsession with grapes in America came in the form of the cultivation, popularity, and exultation of the Concord Grape in the 19th century as a distinctly American cultivar that could be used as both a wine and table grape. The Concord was central to American grape exceptionalism; in seed catalogs of the time, it was the standard of all American grapes. Its creation and rise to prominence are truly mythic and were lauded and disseminated widely at the time. The inventor of the cultivar, Ephraim Bull, lives next to Emerson, Bronson Alcott, and a brief distance from Henry David Thoreau. He began cultivating vines from seedlings that had been “dropped there by birds or carried up the river by local boys” (Pauly 75). After several years of breeding and tending, he developed a grape variety that was “large, good tasting, and hearty” (Pauly 75). This grape skyrocketed to success as both a table and wine grape and propelled its inventor to a political career. (Pauly 76). Contemporary reports on the grape are even more flattering; the following is the first and last paragraph from a full-page story about the grape in The New England Farmer in 1854:
'Long ago impressed with the opinion that our native grape with incapable of being ameliorated and improved, through seeds, Mr. E.W. Bull turned his attention to their production and now has growing more than 2000 seedling plants from some of which he hopes to even beat himself. It will take a long time to prove them all, but the result cannot be otherwise than important; for the natural habit of the vine once changed or broken, variation takes place in such a manner that no opinion can be formed of the product. His success in raising the Concord Grape is the best proof of this. 
“The great want of this country in the latitude is a good table and wine grape, which should be early, hardy, and prolific. The Concord Grape fulfills these conditions and I will sincere pleasure in offering it to my countrymen” E.W. Bull (New England Farmer 1854)'
The narrative of this story is triumphant; while others declared the American grape incapable of being improved, one hardworking farmer, with a democratic impulse, proved that America could produce a grape for both wine and table to rival its European counterparts. Later, as the grape became ubiquitous, more elite writers pushed back against it as a symbol of common taste “many may prefer a greasy mackerel to a trout, a Concord grape to a Delaware because it has been accustomed all its life to the mackerel and Concord grape, not the trout and the Delaware” (Cultivator & Country Gentleman). This discourse had its own pushback; in a brief article titled “Sneering at Common Fruits,” the author writes, “This same kind of talk is occasionally made at the Concord grape…All of this is very foolish…The Concord grape has been of incalculable value to this country…Hundreds of thousands of families annually eat and enjoy grapes because of the introduction of this variety and well ripened Concords are not at all to be sneered at” (Western Rural, 1875). The widespreadness of this grape, seen through these two short articles, catalogs the grapes firm position in American (agri)culture. The constant references to the Concord in seed catalogs are constantly working to situate any other grape to the most imperially successful grape of the Americas, the grape that proved American culture. The rise of grapes and the Concord in America’s culture continues to reinforce the vision of Thomas Jefferson of America as an empire (like Europe) with agriculture that also mirrors Europe.

## Section 4


While efforts to grow wine on the east coast, not only in Virginia but in Pennsylvania and New York, failed, the dream of American wine expanded across the continent with the empire. In the early 19th century, there were unsuccessful attempts to grow wine in the Midwest (Citation). But by the time America expanded to the west coast, another colonial state had already been growing grapes for a century.
Spanish missionary Junipero Serra, a Franciscan, wrote back to Spain about the natural occurrence of grapes in California, and with the establishment of missions came vineyards (Citation). Here European grapes, vinis vinifera, could grow, with a transplant vine from Spain, known as Mission grapes, became the staple of the winemaking industry for the next century and a half (Citation). 
In 1826, the first American planted vines in Los Angeles, and in 1863 a settler-colonist got a grant from Mexico for eleventh thousand acres in Napa Valley and soon after planted vines.

## Section 5

Soon after, the process of making wine became wrapped up in the tools of empire, as Governor John Downey sent a leading vintner, Agoston Haraszthy, to Europe to research how to improve grape-growing practices in California. Instead, he collected (according to him) 100,000 vines from 1,400 varieties to bring back to California. In his report back to the state, he advocated for developing state-run agricultural stations for viticulture research. 
Soon after this trip, the status of California wines rose because of the unintentional impact of America’s empire and plant culture: vine cuttings from America in the 1850s brought an aphid, grape phylloxera, now able to survive the much shorter journey across the Atlantic by steamship, and decimated grapevines across Europe and especially France. In a strange twist of fate, the vines were saved by transplanting American rootstock, unaffected by the aphid, into French vineyards; almost all vines in France and Europe have American origins. 
During this time, winemaking exploded in California and the Napa Valley, only to fall due to years of natural disasters (fires, frosts, and earthquakes), depression, and Prohibition, as the French vines recovered.

 ## Section 6
In the years after Prohibition, Americans’ taste in wine was strong and cheap; nothing “fine.” In response, research that had been ordered under the 1887 Pure Wine Law began in earnest, with the University of California setting up a research station in Davis, right next to the capital. Professionalization began rapidly, with students learning about viticulture at Davis and taking their knowledge to vineyards across the state. In this way, legislation informed the public school system, which created a generation of vintners who desired to make “fine” wines. 
This government-sponsored exceptionalism transformed the wine-making industry in California, with professors guiding the Napa Valley Vintners group towards wine exceptionalism through interventions in control: nitrogen blanketing, induced fermentation, and glass and steel fermentation tanks. One vintner, James D. Zellerbach, was made ambassador to Italy by President Eisenhower and began importing wine to serve at state dinners (Citation). 
America’s imperial affluence also transformed America’s wine industry. Travel exposed Americans to European food and drink; Julia Child led a revolution of French food into the home kitchen, and Jackie Kennedy hired a French chef for the Whitehouse. Exposure and affluence led to changing tastes, in 1967, for the first time since Prohibition, table wines surpassed high-alcohol sweet wines.

  ## Section 7
                                                                   
Finally, through government control, imperial affluence, bureaucracy, expansion across a continent, and no doubt the destruction of Europes viticulture through invasive species, Americans felt ready to prove false the claim of degeneration levied by European writers two centuries earlier. The event was informal and unsanctioned: Patricia Gallagher and Steve Spurrier organized it, buying bottles of wines themselves at vineyards across France and California, renting a room in a hotel, and inviting a panel of illustrious French wine experts for what they were told was just a tasting California wine. Attention was focused on attracting the French Press, especially Le Monde and Le Figaro—the biggest newspapers in Paris, but neither paper sent journalists. Afterward, the event got two small mentions in those two papers, dismissing the event as insignificant and “silly.”

 ##  Section 8
 From America, one journalist covered the event, a writer from Time. After a short article was published in the next month’s issue of Time, stories began to appear in newspapers across the nation, like the Los Angeles Times, The New York Times, and the New Orleans Times-Picayune. The Los Angeles Times article features a cartoon of a cowboy, cigarette in mouth, and a six-shooter aimed at a Frenchman dressed in 19th-century garb and holding a 19th-century gun. The message is clear: America no longer represents degeneracy but strength—Europe is now backward and left behind. Even stranger than this cartoon is the framing of the article—the first paragraph claims that the French are more invested in America’s bicentennial than Americans are and claim credit for America’s independence. The victory of American wines is payback for this imposition and shows that France has nothing to offer America that it cannot provide for itself. In the intervening years, this event has been memorialized with replications at the ten- and thirty-year anniversaries: the American wines continued to win at each event. The tasting has become known by the title of the first American article written about it in Time: The Judgement of Paris.

## Section 8
  
I want to end with this title, given to the event by George Taber, and now the universal name for the tasting. The name comes from Greek mythology, the story of Paris trying to secure his fate by gifting a golden apple to one of the Goddesses. Paris picks Aphrodite, who makes Helen fall in love with him, leading to the Trojan War and the destruction of his empire. The event is most popularly depicted in the Peter Paul Rubens painting The Judgment of Paris (1639), a commission by King Phillip IV of Spain. Even this name is tied up in centuries of the entanglements between empire and plants and shows a thread of imperial power and imperial right coming from the cultivation and use of plants; Paris loses an empire, Phillip adorns his, and America asserts its supremacy.
