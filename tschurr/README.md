## Section 1

France occupies the first section in the world Atlas of Wine; the section begins: “Despite the best efforts of the country’s temperance lobby, it would be impossible to think about France without wine as it is to think of wine without France” (Johnson & Robinson 52). In one sentence, the epistemology of an empire is inextricable from viticulture, while the moral standing of the country against wine is also reified; there is a strong implied contrast of superiority to countries without the refinement of “temperance lobbies.” The passage continues: “The map shows France’s administrative departments and, arguable more important to national pride and pleasure, her many varied wine regions” (Johnson & Robinson 52). European cartographies and geographies display an administrative and agricultural state on the map, overlayed and interlaced. “National pride” is not only tied to “administrative departments” and wine regions but also to “international pleasure”—the successful export of France’s agricultural products in a globalized world. Continuing in the same passage: “Names such as burgundy and champagne have long been so redolent of greatness in wine that, much to the disgust of the French, they have in their time been liberally borrowed without apology” (Johnson & Robinson 52). And here is the spread of imperial influence, the desire for other nation-states to establish themselves as “cultivated,” in all its senses, by copying the established standard-bearer of the most culturally important European agricultural crop. A few paragraphs later: “France still supplies more great wine, and in greater variety, than any other country. Geography is key. France, washed by the Atlantic and lapped by the Mediterranean, is uniquely well situated with the influence of the continent to the east, and a rich variety of soils, including more of the precious calcaire (limestone) so propitious to wine quality, than any other country” (Johnson & Robinson 52). The “still” in this passage is interesting—what it suggests, and what will go on to be a topic of this paper, is the rise of wine elsewhere, especially in the United States. And finally, from this section: “But Frances not only has good vineyards; she defines, classifies, and controls them in more detail and has a longer history of this, and producing fine wine, than any other country…” (Johnson & Robinson 52). The imperial administrative state and the agricultural state are one and the same, both reliant on each other—definition, classification, and control, tools of the empire, are what make for good wine.

## Section 2
       
Wine has been tied up with the cultural imaginary of empire in the west for millennia; a book about wine in America attributed the quote “Nothing more excellent or valuable than wine was ever granted by the god to man” to Plato. Whether or not he said that (it seems unlikely ), the implication is of America carrying on some classical practice or thought, placing wine as a through line connecting a series of empires. Not only this there a romantic notion of wine and its place in the west, but the qualities of what makes a great wine, decided upon by this empire, are, in fact, an expression of imperial power—classification, large amounts of land over various climates, regulation, worldwide trade, and bureaucracy. Pictured are two wines from “We the People” winery, a politically conservative producer that donates part of its profits to causes that “reflect our values.” How did wine get enmeshed with American supremacy and empire such that this group selling abhorrent values would use wine as its vehicle? ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102606973/164264890-fa744cbf-48e3-4bbf-afa3-1e6607849b3d.png)
