# "A Denizen of England:" Anglicizing Tea in the Early Modern Britain


Blackie & Son’s 1860s [^1] print (engraved by Thomas Brown after Joseph Lionel Williams’ drawings), entitled “Tea_Its Cultivation and Preparation,” is a curious menagerie of nine scenes. Early catalogers and present-day antique print dealers both designated the print as “showing tea cultivation and preparation on an Indian plantation” or “showing the stages of tea production in Assam,” but a closer look will cast doubt upon the accuracy of their descriptions. Of the nine scenes, only two were distinctly “Indian” and captioned “Assam:” the right one on the second row captioned “New Station, Rosekandy, Coolie Lines Assam” and the bottom center one captioned “Coolies Assam.” The rest of the scenes however depart starkly from the field of Assam, depicting laborers in garbs and hairstyles characteristic of Qing China (1636–1912) and the vernacular brick architecture of the tea-planting southeastern China, which was by no means verbally explicit. The showcase of “Coolies Assam” and the oblivion of Chinese tea-farmers in the Blackie print is emblematic of the imperial scheme to anglicize tea, both culturally and agriculturally. I argue that between the mid seventeenth and the early nineteenth centuries, the constant endeavor to make tea and tea culture British exemplified and fortified the tenets and practices of imperial Britain: social and racial hierarchy, Anglo-Saxon dominance, and Christian and colonial expansion.

The British endeavor to claim tea, as Erika Rappaport notices in *A Thirst for Empire*, may be traced back to as early as the debut of the drink in the Restoration England. In 1663[^2], Edmund Waller effusively wrote “Of Tea, Commended by Her Majesty,” an ode to the Portuguese Queen of Charles II Catherine of Braganza, who allegedly brought the new trend of tea drinking to the island[^3]. Rappaport claims that Waller’s appositional “best of Queens, and best of herbs” (Waller 221) staged the conversion of “a Catholic and Portuguese queen and a Chinese drink into lauded symbols of Britishness” (Rappaport 35), but the latter part of her statement needs qualification. Exclaiming “we owe/To that bold nation, which the way did show/To the fair region, where the sun does rise;/Whose rich productions we so justly prize,” Waller deemed tea as an exemplary trophy of Portugal’s “bold” colonial expansion and trade, whose Far Eastern extraction was dismissed as a welcomed and coveted destination for future “just” colonial exploitation. Therefore, the incorporation and appropriation of tea into Western-Europeanness already premised the poem. In 1664, Waller learned an allegedly Chinese recipe for making tea by way of a Jesuit and recommended some tweaks for the British practice: “the water is to remain upon [the tea], no longer that whiles you can say the Miserere Psalm very leisurely,” so that “the earthy parts of the herb” would not be extracted into the water and that “only the spiritual parts of the Tea, which is much more active, penetrative and friendly to nature” shall be preserved and consumed (Digby 156). As explained by Ellis et al., in early modern period, the Miserere was “a common unit for the measure of time in recipes.” Recorded in a cookbook reprinted in three editions during the 1670s, Waller’s recipe, with its convenient accompaniment of a penitential psalm and preoccupation with imbibing the spiritual — the religious — embodied and publicized the imperial project to anglicize and baptize tea.

John Chamberlayne’s 1682 pamphlet, *The Natural History of Coffee, Thee, Chocolate, Tobacco* was among the first English naturalist texts to introduce tea. In his title-page, Chamberlayne, a Protestant and son of a stalwart Royalist, claimed no originality and primary research, his work serving only as a curated clearing house for tea knowledge, “Collected the Writings of the best Physicians, and Modern Travellers [sic].” Rappaport reads Chamberlayne’s discourse as “acknowledg[ing] tea’s Asian provenance,” but his exact diction, that tea was a herb “commonly found” in East Asia, betrayed his reservations about the origin of tea, which was echoed in his summary of early European endeavors to localize tea and unearth its European equivalent:

>. . . there is a great Controversie amongst the Herbalists, to what Classis this *Thee* may be reduc’d, *Bontius* compares it to the leaves of our wild *Daisy*; for which *Simon Pauli* is very angry with him, and gives very strong Arguments, that *Thee* is the Leaves of a sort of *Myrtle*, for out of the Leaves of *Myrtle*, a Liquor may be made, resembling *Thee* in all qualities, therefore the Jesuite *Trigautius* is of an opinion, that several of our European Forrests and Woods do abound with a true *Thee* . . . [sic] (Chamberlayne 9)

Chamberlayne continued to challenge the geographical origin of tea with a theory of tea coming originally from Tartary, who “with the several great Conquests . . . in China” (9) introduced the cultivation and knowledge of tea into the country. His approbation of the expansionism of the “great Conquests” of Tartar recurred later when he mentions the consumption of plant drinks resembling tea observed among native peoples in the American Atlantic, as Rappaport reads it as a strong stance to “promote the value of the North American colonies” (38). Around the same time, Chamberlayne also translated and endorsed Philippe-Sylvestre Dufour’s *The Manner of Making of Coffee, Tea, and Chocolate*, who attributed tea to “Divine Providence,” believed bioprospecting to be a Christian duty, and thus “placed the Chinese drink within a Western Christian framework” (Rappaport 38). Rather than Rappaport’s interpretation that Chamberlayne “adhere[s] . . . to Chinese medical theories” (38) to recommend the virtues of tea, the testimonials he invoked were mostly from Jesuit missionaries (one of whom affirms that drinking tea had facilitated performing religious duties at night), European ambassadors, and, as he believed to be carrying greatest weight, the “famous Countryman” Robert Boyle. Although Chamberlayne did propose Japanese and Chinese practices of tea drinking, predominantly invested in tea in his treatise was the British persistence of social and racial hierarchy — as he ranked the quality of Japanese tea above that of Chinese by extrapolation from their different trade values, and as he highlighted the quotidian and fastidious consumption of tea among the nobility in those countries (Chamberlayne 8–10) — and the advocacy and impetus for Britain’s colonial conquest and expansion.

The first decade of the eighteenth century saw an unprecedented surge in importation of tea from China to Britain, which allowed for and capitalized on the vogue for tea drinking in Britain among a wider consumer base than the upper class, admittedly extravagant yet few in size. According to Ellis et al., the surge was the outcome of the brief but seminal competitions between the Old and New East Indian Companies (55). With the business acumen, audacity, and ambition of the directors, the New Company succeeded in opening up the relatively untapped Chinese market and especially the untested waters of Canton, and the growing reputation of and the aristocratic favor for tea led to the Company’ awaking to its marketing potential (Ellis et al. 56–58). During this early period of the British tea boom, consumers were either charmed or repelled by the exoticism and novelty of the plant. The English names of different sorts of tea, proposed by John Ovington in his 1696 travel account, *A Voyage to Suratt* (Ellis et al. 76) and later popularized in his 1699 treatise, *An Essay upon the Nature and Qualities of Tea*, preserved (or at least imitated) their Chinese pronunciation: Bohe, Singlo, and Bing. This nomenclature made their ways into the list of required investments of the East India Company in 1702 (Ellis et al. 58), later with expansion flowed into common usage among merchants, consumers, and naturalists, and indexed the British epistemology of Chinese tea. Educational pamphlets were published to teach the virtues, grades, and sorts of tea and to preach the “proper” ways of making tea. An early example of these was Humphrey Broadbent’s 1722 tract, *The Domestick Coffee-man, Shewing the True Way of Preparing and Making of Chocolate, Coffee and Tea*, in which he disputed the medicinal omnipotence of Bohea as a panacea for “all inward Wastings,” a myth of the time sewn by “some Emperical [sic] Impostures with which this Country very Scandalously abounds” (Broadbent 13). His social commentary was also seen in his introductory passage: “a pravalent [sic] Curiosity after Novelty, especially in matters of sensual Gratifications, almost continually Multiplies new kinds or distinctions of this Plant upon us, but as the Bohea, and Green, Includes all other subdistinctions, we shall have Regard to no other” (Broadbent 13). Here Broadbent captured the buoyancy of the rapidly expanding tea market and the tactics employed for tea to indulge British palate, cure British ailment, and ultimately be acculturated into British character.

As a foreign plant drink accredited with curative and invigorative properties new to the British consumer society, tea did not fail to attract boycott. An anonymous mock-epic poem written in couplets, entitled “The Ladies Exercise at Tea, with the Rise and Progress thereof, or the Metamorphosis of a Set of Ladies into a Set of China Tea-Cups,” was published in Ireland around 1729. Invoking Homer and Pope, the speaker sensationalized and demonized tea and the emerging socialization of tea drinking among women. Tea on the Earth was brought to Heaven by Mercury at the request of Goddesses, jealous and spiteful under the influence of the “Heav’nly Tea.” Boiling the tea in a pot written as “Box of Evil,” the Goddesses sent Pandora to spread “the Store of Evils” to the Earth, where “[t]he world had never known what’s Evil/Only for Woman and the Devil.” To ramp up their revenge on the mortal women, the Goddesses transmuted them into China tea cups and scattered them to pieces. In the allegory of Mercury — the god of commerce, travels, and theft — the speaker condemned the East India Company’s mercenary introduction of tea, “a Weed” growing along “India’s Shore,” to the Heavenly Britain. As the stimulative effects of tea render women loquacious, rancorous, sacrilegious, and eventually destructive, tea was therefore comparable to both the forbidden fruit and the serpent that perverted Eve and enacted (dehumanizing) death and evil in the Garden of Eden, as it threatened to disrupt the social order upon which Britain was predicated. This anti-tea sentiment would find a hear-hear from the contemporary John Waldron (cf. Rappaport 52) and Daniel Defoe, who regarded tea as “Sour, and acrimonious Liquids which flowed in [women’s] Veins, instead of Blood; that Venom and something Noxious was mingled among their animal Spirits” and belittled female socialization as “the Cabinet Councils of the Tea Table; where the Ladies settle the most Weighty Affairs of the Nation, and without which, 'tis our Opinion, at least, nothing could be well directed” (Defoe et al. 127, 103). In 1756, the anxiety over this Asian plant drink undermining the structures of British masculinity, dominance, and supremacy was fleshed out into a nearly two-hundred-page harangue by Jonas Hanway, which was vehemently lambasted by Samuel Johnson in *The Literary Magazine* a year later. Taking the stance of “a hardened and shameless tea-drinker” with twenty years of daily intake of tea (Johnson 390), Johnson repudiated Hanway’s preoccupation with tea weakening and impoverishing Britain with optimism for British manufacturing at the dawn of Industrial Revolution and suggested that British prosperity hinged not on the already advanced productivity but on the expansion of market (Johnson 402).

From the shared misogynist vigilance it can be inferred that the eighteenth-century British tea practice was cheifly gendered — feminized, and therefore domesticized. Tea drinking, as aforementioned, was well received by late seventeenth-century aristocratic women, but there is dearth of historical records and scholarship as to the exact mechanism of its trickling down through the echelons. Several scholars (Chatterjee, Ellis et al., Martin, etc.) do concur in looking at tea equipage and untangling the ways these aesthetically, functionally, and domestically charged physical objects signify and constitute the gendered and imperial practice of tea in the eighteenth century. In William Hogarth’s 1730 oil-on-canvas, “William Wollaston and his Family in a Grand Interior,” most of the women are gathering to the right, around a silver square tea table with exquisite ornamentation, and elegantly poised in their hands are dainty silver tea cups. They all assume a look of serenity, secluding themselves from the lively, male-dominant card gaming to the left. To borrow Chatterjee’s words, Hogarth’s tea table and tea cups contextualize these patrician women’s “actions of leisure . . . signal[ing] the privilege of not-having-to-labor and the class power that builds upon that idealized, and patriarchal, vision of women’s nonwork” (Chatterjee 40–41). Around the same time, one James Bland published *An Essay in Praise of Women: or, a Looking-Glass for Ladies to See Their Perfections in*, in which he recommended the management of a tea table and the consumption of tea for the young urban wives of London, as the former would enhance their husbands’ social reputation and facilitate their professional performance, the latter being conducive to moderation and pleasant temperament. With its function to socialize and moralize the domestic British women, the tea table had become a common prop for a loosely-defined literature genre of the likes of Eliza Haywood’s casual yet instructional *The Tea-Table: Or, a Conversation Between Some Polite Persons of Both Sexes, . . . Which Form the Character of an Accomplish’d Beau, or Modern Fine Lady. . . .*, its presence lasting well into the twentieth century. The discourse around the tea table suggested that the feminization and domestication of British tea culture in the first century of its popularization was the product of and in turn fueled “the intricate and dialectical oscillations of British imperialism” (Chatterjee 40).

The eighteenth was the century of the East India Company’s monopoly of and heavy reliance on tea trade with China, witnessing ever-growing import (and smuggling) of Chinee tea into Britain (Ellis et al. 174, 197). British narratives of tea had mostly revolved on its status as beverage and as commodity, but the latter half of this century did see two botanical texts on the tea plant. In his 1757 Exotic Botany, John Hill introduced thirty-five plants foreign to Britain with vividly colored engravings. Given the limited access to and knowledge of his specimens, Hill confessed lack of confidence in his differentiation between the Bohea Tea and the Green Tea (Hill “Bohea Tea.”). He laments the possibility that certain substances of tea seeds preclude growth in Europe, but also puts forward a long-standing speculation that China has prevented the exportation of tea seeds to ensure monopoly. John Coakley Lettsom’s *The Natural History of the Tea-Tree* was a thorough dissection of the plant’s natural and botanical properties. In his preface Lettsom instantiates several succeeded or failed attempts to grow tea tree in Europe of late, including “a few young Tea plants [that] have been introduced into some of the most curious botanic gardens about London; hence it seems probable that this very distinguished vegetable will become a denizen of England, and such of her colonies as may be deemed most favourable to its propagation” (vii). Both Lettsom’s optimism and romanticization of the colonial empire and, to an extent, Hill’s doubt on China’s sincerity not only betray the colonial and Anglo-Saxonist purposes behind their botanical study, but unveil Britain’s inextinguishable desire to naturalize tea and to claim it British root and branch. Into the early nineteenth-century, the massive scale of tea import from China alerted Britain to its dependency on this “secretive, remote and unknowable . . . unnerving political ethical challenge to Britain’s growing imperil self-importance” (Ellis et al. 211). Rappaport notes that not long before the breakout of the first Opium War, one British trader pressed for urgent decoupling from China, due to the Celestial Empire’s arrogance and impudence and, for mastering of tea cultivation and trade within the paramountcy of the British empire (Rappaport 90–91). Rare and ironic as it was, Britain was now fighting for its independence. Although the nationalist venture to transplant tea in the British isles fell through, the opportune discovery of tea growing in Assam provided a desired detour. With the conquest of Assam, Britain finally anglicized and imperialized tea in commerce and in agriculture.

It is time to wind back to the Blackie print of “an Indian plantation” “in Assam” and take an even closer look — “New Station” reflects the colonial, racial, and social choreography of hierarchy: two sober-suited English-looking gentlemen in the foreground, a vested and booted overseer gesturing from a distance at an Indian laborer clothed in nothing but a white turban and white shorts, several other Indian laborers in miniature interspersed in the field of tea bushes and vaguely indicated by the black-and-white contrast between their trunks and their turbans and shorts, across the field thatched pavilions dwarfed by the clusters of gigantic buildings in the background. “Coolies Assam” is a carte-de-visite portrait of three variously-clad Indian laborers, singled out and brought to the fore as a token colonial subject. To the left in the first scene, “Preparing the Ground for the Seed,” is an opium-pipe holding Qing male, embodying Britain’s recent colonial defeat of and encroachment on China. For the Chinese scenes, the seven paintings are captioned with prominence given to the verbs delineating the process of tea cultivation and preparation, effacing the many subjects of Chinese laborers engaging and entailed in that exact process. Yet for the audience of the print in “London, Glasgow, Edinburgh & Dublin,” the print must have looked pastoral and organized, showing exotic subjects refined by the British civility laboring for the cultivation and preparation of “Tea” — or, it goes without saying, English Tea.

## Notes

[^1]: The Henry Wellcome Collection dated the Blackie print to 1850s, but I argue that it was made at least a decade later. The “New Station” scene seems to be a faithful reproduction of [Oscar Jean-Baptiste Mallitte’s photograph of a tea garden near Cachar taken in the 1860s](http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/apac/photocoll/t/019pho000000913u00033000.html). Therefore the Blackie print could hardly predate 1860s.
[^2]: In Empire of Tea, Ellis et al. point out that the undated poem was published posthumously, first appearing in print in 1690, and suggest that it was composed in the early 1680s (Ellis et al, 39). 
[^3]: This account was contested by Rappaport. She demonstrates how tea-drinking had already been practiced among Royalists during exile and how the East India Company bribed Charles II with tea for his favor before his marriage with Catherine. Another unattested yet widespread historical account of aristocratic introduction of tea to England was that Lords Arlington and Ossory of Holland brought tea to the island in 1666, and tea-drinking was then favorably and fashionably received by the upper-class British women with endorsement from their wives (Hanway 215). Ellis et al. sorted out three strands of early British encounter with tea between 1650s and 1660s, i.e. naturalists and physicians, merchants, and the aforesaid female aristocrats (31).
